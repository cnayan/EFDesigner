This Visual Studio 2019 extension is an opinionated code generator, adding a new file type (.efmodel) that allows for fast, easy and, most importantly, **visual** design 
of persistent classes. Inheritance, unidirectional and bidirectional associations are all supported. Enumerations are also included in 
the visual model, as is the ability to add text blocks to explain potentially arcane parts of your design.

While giving you complete control over how the code is generated you'll be able to create, out of the box, sophisticated, 
consistent and **correct** Entity Framework code that can be regenerated when your model changes. And, since the code is written using 
partial classes, any additions you make to your generated code are retained across subsequent generations.

If you are used to the EF visual modeling that comes with Visual Studio, you'll be pretty much at home. The goal was to duplicate 
at least those features and, in addition, add all the little things that _should_ have been there. Things like:

*   importing entities from C# source, or existing DbContext definitions (including their entities) from compiled EF6 or EFCore assemblies
*   the ability to show and hide parts of the model
*   easy customization of generated output by editing or even replacing the T4 templates
*   entities by default generated as partial classes so the generated code can be easily extended
*   class and enumeration nodes that can be colored to visually group the model
*   different concerns being generated into different subdirectories (entities, enums, dbcontext)
*   string length, index flags, required attributes and other properties being available in the designer

and many other nice-to-have bits.

**ChangeLog**

**2.0.0.0** (next version, [RC2 now available on Github](https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/releases/tag/V2.0.0-RC2))
   - **Dropped support for Visual Studio 2017**; was getting to be too much to keep the tool viable for that Visual Studio version.
   - **[NEW]** It's now possible to have multiple diagrams for the same model, each showing a different view and synchronized as the model changes. Perfect for helping to understand large models.
   - **[NEW]** Added ability to specify foreign key properties  (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/55)
   - **[NEW]** Foreign key properties have a unique glyph so they can be easily picked out of the crowd
   - **[NEW]** Foreign key properties that are primary keys also have a unique but different glyph
   - **[NEW]** Completely restructured assembly parsers; they now cleanly handle all combinations of EF6/EFCore2/EFCore3 and .NETCore2/.NETCore3/.NETFramework
   - **[NEW]** Modified assembly parsers to find declared foreign keys and add them to the model appropriately
   - **[NEW]** Added options dialog (Tools/Options/Entity Framework Visual Editor)
   - **[NEW]** Added use of GraphViz for model layout (if installed and path is added to "Tools/Options/Entity Framework Visual Editor")
   - **[NEW]** Added switch to disable generation of classes and enumerations for those cases where they are coming from different assemblies but need to be in the model to avoid errors.
   - **[NEW]** Added visual indicator on classes and enumerations where code generation is disabled
   - **[NEW]** Added ability to override the base class of the generated DbContext to be something other than "DbContext"
   - **[NEW]** Attributes can now be flagged as abstract in the same way classes can.
   - **[NEW]** Join tables in many-to-many associations can now have custom names (EF6 only, until EFCore supports many-to-many cardinalities)
   - **[NEW]** Removing an enumeration removes all entity properties that use that enumeration, after displaying a warning.
   - Renamed toolbox category to "EF Model Diagrams"
   - Enhanced display of model elements in the Visual Studio property window's object list
   - Removed MSAGL layouts. No one understood them anyway.
   - Removed tool automatically installing NuGet packages. Too volatile.

   - Fix: bad merge broke MaxLength and MinLength properties in entity string properties (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/103)
   - Fix: attribute parser ("edit as code" feature) didn't handle enumeration initial values well; it does now (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/104)
   - Fix: showing cascade delete in the designer worked inconsistently (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/108)
   - Fix: drag and drop developed regressions (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/112 and https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/114)
   - Fix: undo threw null reference errors when undoing drag and drop from code files (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/113)
   - Fix: 'KeyBuilder' does not contain definition for 'Ignore' in EF Core (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/115)

   - **[NEW]** To more fully support DDD models, added a toggle for persisting either the property or its backing field (if not an autoproperty) for EFCore
